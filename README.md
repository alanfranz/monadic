# Monadic

is a gem to help dealing with exceptional situations, it comes from the sphere of functional programming and bringing the goodies I have come to love in Scala to my ruby projects (hence I will be using more Scala like constructs than Haskell).

See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad

Planned are the following monadics:

- Option (Maybe in Haskell)
- Either

## Installation
